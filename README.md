This is a React Native project.

This is a personal app that I wanted to create for myself.

It is a simple application that takes Income and Expenses as an Input and showcases to the user how their expenses get allocated a month at a time.

I decided to build this application for two reasons: First, I wanted to have a simple way to track my expenses on a monthly basis. Secondly, I wanted to continue to work on my mobile development skills.

This project is still on going.
